<p class="h4">When We Collect Your Personal Information</p>

<p>When we request information from you in accordance to our policies outlined above, we may ask for personally identifiable information including your:</p>
<ul class="with-bullets">
    <li>name;</li>
    <li>email address;</li>

<p class="h4">How Personal Information Is Secured</p>
<p>Your information is protected by secure firewalls (communication management computers specially designed to keep information secure and inaccessible by other Internet users).</p>
<p>You’re safe while you shop; and if you choose to store your personal information with us, it’s always secure and protected by your own password.</p>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, Brimar Industries has put in place advanced and appropriate physical, electronic, testing, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure all the information we collect. Total security includes firewalls, intruder detection, testing, and physical security.</p>
<p>Although we take careful measures to secure both your information and our physical premises, “perfect security” does not exist on the internet; and our efforts in this regard must necessarily be limited by what is practical in light of our equipment and technology.</p>

<div class="help-term prepend-top">
<p class="h4">How We Use Credit Card Information</p>
<p>Sensitive/credit information is transferred to our secure server using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. The only people who have access to your credit card information are banking institutions and their intermediaries. The website and hosting company do not store the information. All the information is received encrypted and remains encrypted.</p>
