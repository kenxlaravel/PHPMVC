	<p class="small-text note italic">This document was last updated on 04/11/2013 using NFPA 704 2012 Edition</p>
</div>
<div class="help-term prepend-top">
	<p>The <strong>NFPA 704 diamond system</strong> is  intended to provide basic information to fire fighting, emergency and other personnel. This standard provides a readily recognized, easily understood system for identifying specific hazards and their severity using spatial, visual, and numerical methods to describe in simple terms the relative hazards of a material. These placards act as an immediate  warning system for emergency service personnel, addressing health, flammability, instability, and special hazards that may be  present, acute exposures that are most likely to occur  as a result of fire, spill, or similar emergencies.</p>
	<p><strong>NFPA 704 Hazardous Materials Identification System </strong><br />Signs must be in locations approved by the authority having jurisdiction and as a minimum must be posted at the following locations:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Two exterior walls or enclosures containing a means of access to a building or facility</li>
		<li>Each access to a room or area</li>
		<li>Each principal means of access to an exterior storage area</li>
		<li>If there are numerous areas where the emergency personnel could enter, then, there should be numerous signs covering those areas.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>Position NFPA Diamond signs on stationary containers and above-ground tanks and at entrances to locations where hazardous  materials are stored, dispensed, used or handled in quantities that require an operational permit. The purpose of these signs is  to assist first responders in recognizing and identifying possible hazards, thus they should be placed as to be readily visible with  respect to location and size.</p>

<p><strong>Where can I find the NFPA 704 ratings for my chemicals?</strong> <br />(health, flammability, instability, and special hazard information such as oxidizers, water reactivity, or simple asphyxiant gases.)  The best source for the NFPA 704 ratings of a material is the Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which can be obtained from  the supplier of the material. The NFPA 704 ratings usually can be located in Section 16 of the SDS. Other sources are reference material including the NFPA Fire Protection Guide on Hazardous Materials, and many other reference books and  data bases on hazardous materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="help-term prepend-top">
	<p class="h5"><strong>Why should the NFPA 704 Rating System be used?</strong></p>
	<p>The 704 rating system is applicable to industrial, commercial, and institutional facilities that manufacture, process, use, or store hazardous materials. Please note this standard is not applicable to transportation (DOT) or for use by the general public.</p>
	<p><strong>This standard objectives are, as stated by NFPA: </strong></p>
	<ul class="with-bullets pad-left-20">
		<li>These signs provide an appropriate signal or alert for the protection of both public and private emergency response personnel.</li>
		<li>To assist in planning for effective fire and emergency control operations, including clean-up.</li>
		<li>To assist all designated personnel, engineers, plant, and safety personnel in evaluating hazards.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="h5"><strong>Understanding the NFPA 704 sign? </strong></p>
	<p> This is diamond-shaped sign with four smaller quadrants/diamonds inside. One diamond is blue, one is red, one is yellow and one is white,  as shown on image. The diamond-shaped signs use the four color-coded categories to give at a glance a general idea of the  hazards that personnel or observers are exposed to in any specific area.</p>
	<div class="span-8 append-bottom-20"><img src="/images/NFPA-Signs-Classification.png" alt="U-channel Post Mounting" width="295" height="284" /></div>
	<div class="span-9 last prepend-top"><p>The number in each inner quadrant represents the hazard rating for each of the 3 categories. Each material is assigned a rating  in these three categories: health (blue), flammability (red), and instability (yellow). The white box is reserved for special hazards such as  water reactivity, oxidizers or simple asphyxiant gases. The health, flammability, and instability ratings of a material vary according to its physical and chemical  characteristics. The ratings are 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0, with 4, indicating severe hazard or extreme danger, to 0, indicating no required  warning is necessary. Each rating is described on the image to the side.</p></div>

	<p class="h5"><strong>Hazard Category: FLAMMABILITY (Red)</strong></p>
	<p>Because many materials will burn under one set of conditions but will not burn under others, the form or condition of the material shall be considered, along with its inherent properties</p>
	<p><strong>Degrees of Hazard:</strong> The degrees of flammability hazard shall be ranked according to the susceptibility of materials to burning.</p>

	<p class="prepend-top"><strong>Rating 4:</strong> Materials that rapidly or completely vaporize at atmospheric pressure and normal ambient temperature or that are readily dispersed in air and burn readily.</p>
	<ul class="with-bullets pad-left-20">

		<li>Materials that ignite spontaneously when exposed to air</li>
		<li>Solids containing greater than 0.5 percent by weight of a flammable or combustible solvent are rated by the closed cup flash point of the solvent.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="prepend-top"><strong>Rating 3:</strong> Liquids and solids (including finely divided suspended solids) that can be ignited under almost all ambient temperature conditions. Materials in this degree produce hazardous atmospheres with air under almost all ambient temperatures or, though unaffected by ambient temperatures, are readily ignited under almost all conditions. See Annex D for more information on ranking of combustible dusts.</p>
	<ul class="with-bullets pad-left-20">
		<li>Liquids having a flash point below 22.8°C (73°F) and a boiling point at or above 37.8°C (100°F) and those liquids having a flash point at or above 22.8°C (73°F) and below 37.8°C (100°F) (i.e., Class IB and Class IC liquids) </li>

	<p class="prepend-top"><strong>Rating 2:</strong> Materials that must be moderately heated or exposed to relatively high ambient temperatures before ignition can occur. Under normal conditions, these materials would not form hazardous atmospheres with air, but under high ambient temperatures or under moderate heating they could release vapor in sufficient quantities to produce hazardous atmospheres with air.
