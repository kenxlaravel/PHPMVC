If the potential winner cannot be contacted, does not respond, or is determined by the Sponsor to be an ineligible entrant within one (1) day after the date of the first attempt to contact him/her, the Sponsor may select an alternate potential winner in his/her place at random from the remaining non-winning, eligible entries.</p>
